# Structural Quadrant Method

Botella, J. G. L. (2000). The structural quadrants method: A new approach to the assessment of construct system complexity via the repertory grid. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 13(1), 1-26.

I have written this function in the attempt to automatise the calculation of the integration and differentiation indexes as theorised by Galiffa and Botella in paper above. the function returns the differentiation and integration indexes the method for analysis is obscure in the paper and I cannot replicate the results here. Therefore this function is currently in the status of DRAFT. 

The function should work fine and it is an implementation of the SQM as per the methodological paper published. Unfortunately I don't think the maths behind its sound or perhaps there are some unconsidered issues by which the results of the functions are more or less stable depending on the mathematical characteristics of the vectors that are analysised.

The idea and the purpose of the paper is fashinating but I think this method is flawed or my interpretation is wrong then I would welcome any suggestion to get this right as it is unclear from the publication how certain methodological details of the analysis could be interpreted differently

I have invited Richard Bell who (witho our email correspondance) has contributed significantly to the thinking behind my implementation of the method.
